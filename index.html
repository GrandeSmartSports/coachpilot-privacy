        <main>
            <p>
                CoachPilot - Practice Plans ("the App") is developed by Daniel Grande. Your privacy is
                important to us. This policy explains how the App handles your information.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p>
                    <strong>In short:</strong> The App does not collect personal data, does not require
                    an account, does not track you, and does not use analytics. When you generate AI-powered
                    practice plans, your coaching input is sent to Anthropic's Claude AI service to create
                    personalized plans for you.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>
                The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. Specifically:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>No account or login is required to use the App.</li>
                <li>No personal data (name, email, location, or device identifiers) is collected.</li>
                <li>No analytics or usage tracking of any kind is used.</li>
                <li>No cookies or similar tracking technologies are used.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>AI-Powered Plan Generation:</strong> When you generate a practice plan or player
                report, the text input you provide (such as roster information, player details, coaching
                notes, and practice parameters) is sent to the <strong>Claude AI service</strong>
                (provided by Anthropic) to create personalized plans tailored to your coaching situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                This data is transmitted securely to Anthropic's servers, processed by their AI system,
                and used solely for the purpose of generating your plan. The data is <strong>not stored</strong>
                by Anthropic after your plan is generated, and it is <strong>not used to train</strong>
                their AI models. No other information (device identifiers, location, or personal data) is
                sent to the Claude AI service.
            </p>
            <p>
                All generated plans, roster information, and app settings are stored locally on your
                device only.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
            <p>
                All practice plans, roster information, and app settings are stored locally on your
                device. We do not operate servers that store your data. If you delete the App, all
                locally stored data is removed.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
                The App uses the <strong>Claude AI service</strong> (provided by Anthropic) to generate
                AI-powered practice plans and player reports. When you use the plan generator or
                evaluation wizard, your coaching input is transmitted to Anthropic's servers for processing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What data is shared with Claude AI:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Text input you provide: roster details, player names, positions, skill levels, coaching notes, practice parameters</li>
                <li>Sport, age group, and practice duration selections</li>
                <li>Template or wizard choices you make in the app</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>What is NOT shared:</strong> Device identifiers, location data, contact information,
                photos, or any data you have not explicitly entered into the plan generator.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How Anthropic handles your data:</strong> Anthropic processes your input to generate
                your plan and immediately discards it. The data is not stored, not used to train AI models,
                and not shared with other parties. Anthropic's full data handling practices are governed
                by their <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy policy</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before your first AI-powered generation, the App will show you a consent screen explaining
                this data sharing. You must consent to proceed with AI-powered plan generation.
            </p>
            <p>
                No other data is shared with any third parties.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Camera and Photo Library</h2>
            <p>
                The App may request access to your device's camera or photo library to enable roster
                scanning via OCR (optical character recognition). This feature uses Apple's on-device
                Vision framework to read text from images.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>All image processing occurs entirely on your device.</li>
                <li>Images are never uploaded to any server.</li>
                <li>The App does not store the original images after processing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                The App is rated 4+ and is suitable for all ages. Because the App does not collect any
                personal data from any user, it does not knowingly collect information from children
                under the age of 13. The App complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection
                Act (COPPA).
            </p>

            <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on
                this page with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy
                periodically.
